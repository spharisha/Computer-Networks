##Projects 

###1.Socket Programming-TCP Client/Server
Server and Client programs are implemented. The server creates a stream socket (i.e., TCP) 
in the Internet domain bound to a port number, receives requests from a client, produces 
results based on the content of requests, and sends the results back to the client on the
same connection.

###2.Event-driven Simulation of a Link
An event-driven simulator to simulate a simple link is implemented. Packets arrive at the 
link at various times. If the link is already transmitting a packet while another packet 
arrives, the new packet is stored in the link's buffer.
